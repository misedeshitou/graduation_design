## Usage

### Online Use

#### Using Directly via Overleaf Template

You can use this template directly via the [Overleaf template link](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/tongji-university-undergraduate-thesis-template/tfvdvyggqybn).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When using the Overleaf template, please check the compiler and main entry settings:
>
> - Set `main.tex` as the main entry file, instead of other `.tex` files in the project (especially `tongjithesis.cls` or `tongjithesis.sty`);
> - It is recommended to use the `XeLaTeX` or `LuaLaTeX` compilers, as some compilers (such as `pdfLaTeX`) are not supported by this template.

#### Importing This Repository on Overleaf

- Download this repository via `Code | Download ZIP` at the top of the repository home page file list;
- Open [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/);
- Upload the downloaded `zip` file to Overleaf by dragging and dropping.

#### Compiling in GitHub Actions

The project is configured with GitHub Actions in `.github/workflows/*.yaml`. Pushing code to a fork repository or a template-generated repository will trigger tests. You can obtain build artifacts for multiple platforms from the `Summary | Artifacts` section of the workflow run associated with the commit.

(Enable GitHub Actions by checking `Settings | Actions | General | Allow all actions and reusable workflows`)

### Local Use

#### Installing TeX Distribution

We recommend installing TeX Live (Windows, Linux) or MacTeX (macOS) following the [official quick install guide](https://tug.org/texlive/quickinstall.html).

#### Building the Project

We recommend building the project via the command line. Alternatively, you can use the VS Code LaTeX Workshop plugin.

##### Command Line

###### Makefile (Linux/macOS)

```shell
make all                # compile main.pdf
make ENGINE=$ENGINE all # use $ENGINE (where $ENGINE=-xelatex or -lualatex) to compile main.pdf
make clean              # remove intermediate files
make cleanall           # remove all intermediate files (including .pdf)
make wordcount          # word count
```

###### Batchfile (Windows)

```bat
.\make.bat                # the same to "make.bat thesis"
.\make.bat thesis         # compile main.pdf
.\make.bat thesis $ENGINE # use $ENGINE (where $ENGINE=-xelatex or -lualatex) to compile main.pdf
.\make.bat clean          # clean all work files by latexmk -c
.\make.bat cleanall       # clean all work files and main.pdf by latexmk -C
.\make.bat wordcount      # wordcount
.\make.bat help           # read the manual
```

<details><summary><b>Using VS Code and LaTeX Workshop Plugin</b></summary>

Install the LaTeX Workshop plugin in VS Code, and then **open the root directory of this project directly** (i.e., the `tongji-undergrad-thesis` folder, not a parent folder, otherwise `.vscode/settings.json` will not take effect).

Since we have configured the LaTeX Workshop plugin in `.vscode/settings.json`, you only need to:

- Select the `main.tex` file;
- Click the button with the $\TeX$ icon on the left sidebar;
- Click `Recipe: latexmk (xelatex)` from the `Build LaTeX project` list to compile the `.pdf` file.

Alternatively, the LaTeX Workshop plugin will automatically compile the file when you save it.

### Template Configuration

#### Document Class Options

This template provides the following document class options, which can be configured in `main.tex`:

```latex
\documentclass[
  oneside,           % One-sided printing (default), use twoside for double-sided printing
  fullwidthstop=false, % Whether to replace Chinese period "。" with Western-style period "．", default is false
  fontset=fandol,    % Font set to use, default is fandol
  times=false,       % Whether to use Times New Roman font, default is false
  minted=true,       % Whether to use the minted package for code highlighting, default is true
  biblatex=true,     % Whether to use biblatex for bibliography management, default is true
]{tongjithesis}

\tjbibresource{bib/note.bib}  % Specify bib files (supports multiple, comma-separated)
```

<details><summary><b>Detailed option descriptions</b></summary>

##### Single/Double-Sided Printing Options

- `oneside`: Single-sided printing (default)
- `twoside`: Double-sided printing, adjusts page margins and binding line

##### Font Options

- `fontset=fandol`: Use Fandol font set (default)
- `fontset=adobe`: Use Adobe font set (requires Adobe fonts installation)
- `times=false`: Use `newtx` package fonts (default)
- `times=true`: Use Times New Roman font

##### Chinese Punctuation Options

- `fullwidthstop=false`: Keep Chinese period "。" unchanged (default)
- `fullwidthstop=true`: Replace Chinese period "。" with Western-style period "．"

##### Bibliography Options

- `biblatex=true`: Use `biblatex` (biber backend) for bibliography management (default)
- `biblatex=false`: Use `bibtex` with `gbt7714` package for bibliography management

Use `\tjbibresource{file1.bib,file2.bib}` to specify bib files, and `\makereferences` to output the bibliography.

</details>

<details><summary><b>Rendering Rare Characters</b></summary>

Due to the default use of the Fandol font in this template, support for rare characters such as names and specific terms might not be adequate. We provide the Adobe font set in the [`fonts`](https://github.com/TJ-CSCCG/tongji-undergrad-thesis/tree/fonts) branch of our GitHub repository. You can download and install these fonts, and then use the `fontset=adobe` option in `main.tex` to use the Adobe font set:

```latex
\documentclass[
  oneside,
  fontset=adobe,
  % other options...
]{tongjithesis}
```

This modification will switch the rendering in the document to use the Adobe font set, enhancing support for rare characters.

**Note**: Placing Adobe font files in the project's root directory and specifying the font path in `main.tex` is not always effective. Therefore, we recommend installing the Adobe fonts into the system font directory. Tests show that placing Adobe font files in the root directory of an Overleaf project and using LuaLaTeX for compilation works, but this method may slow down the compilation process.

</details>

#### Code Highlighting Options

This template provides two code highlighting solutions:

1. **`minted` package** (Python-based): Provides advanced syntax highlighting features, requires Python environment.
   - Enable by setting `minted=true` (default) in `main.tex`
   - Requires installation of Python and Pygments library (`pip install pygments`)
   - You need to add Python to the system `PATH` environment variable,
     - or specify the Python path in `main.tex` (see below)
   - Requires `-shell-escape` parameter during compilation (this template has added)

2. **`listings` package** (pure LaTeX): Does not depend on external programs, can be used in any environment.
   - Enable by setting `minted=false` in `main.tex`
   - No additional program installation required

If you do not want to install Python or encounter `minted`-related errors, you can change `minted=true` to `minted=false` in `main.tex`. When using `minted=false`, the template will automatically use the `listings` package to process all code, without requiring additional configuration.

<details><summary>Using <code>minted</code> but don't want to add Python to the <code>PATH</code> environment variable?</summary>

You can add a redirection to the Python path of the `minted` package in the `main.tex` file:

```latex
\renewcommand{\MintedPython}{/path/to/your/python}
```
